1. The 561 columns in X_train.txt and X_test.txt are the 561 features measurements decribed in features.txt. 
2. The subject ID for train and test data sets are given in corresponding subject_*.txt. 30 subjects in total. 
- 21 subjects (70%) in training data set
ID: 1  3  5  6  7  8 11 14 15 16 17 19 21 22 23 25 26 27 28 29 30
- 9 subjects (30%) in test data set
ID:  2  4  9 10 12 13 18 20 24
3. Activity numberic codes are given in y_*.txt with * corresponding to train and test for the two sets. Code description is in activity_lables.txt.
4. trainf and testf are two dataframes with subjects, activity and 561 feature measurements combined for train and test respectively. 
5. OneDataSet is the joined trainf and testf data frame for task 1. 
6. ExtractedDataSet is the dataframe extracted from the complete data set with features containing mean() and std() in their names. 
7. ActLabelledDataSet is the dataframe with descriptions given to each activity code. 
8. TriaxialSignalDataSet is the dataframe that contains the tri-axial mean measurements of the three signal categories 
- Triaxial total acceleration from the accelerometer: tBodyAcc-[XYZ] 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope: tBodyGyro-[XYZ] 
- Triaxial total Gravity: tGravity-[XYZ] 
Note that there are multiple features for some categories, eg., tBodyAccJerk, tBodyGyroJerk. Therefore, there are 15 features included in the selection criterion instead of 9. 
9. a the the molten dataframe with each feature in TriaxialSignalDataSet became a row. The feature was identified by the "signal" column in a.
10. b is the dataframe casted from a by aggregation the measurments to the nine desired signal categories: 
(X, Y, Z)*(tBodyAcc, tBodyGyro, tGravity). 
11. fdata.txt is the final tidy dataset lists the nine triaxial signals for each activity and each subject, ordered by subject ID.
